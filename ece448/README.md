# Artificial Intelligence Course Projects – UIUC ECE448

This directory contains a comprehensive set of projects developed as part of UIUC's ECE448: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The coursework emphasizes foundational AI concepts through hands-on implementations in Python and PyTorch. These projects span topics in machine learning, reasoning under uncertainty, search and planning, and neural networks.

## Overview

The assignments are designed to reflect both theoretical understanding and practical skills. Each project builds on fundamental AI principles and emphasizes algorithmic thinking, statistical modeling, and scalable software design. Code is implemented from scratch with minimal reliance on external libraries, demonstrating a deep engagement with core AI mechanics.

## Topics Covered

- Search algorithms and path planning  
- Probabilistic reasoning and inference  
- Supervised learning and classification  
- Regression and optimization  
- Reinforcement learning and MDPs  
- Neural networks and deep learning  

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to a standalone project with its own documentation, code, and evaluation script. Projects are implemented in Python and follow modular and reusable design patterns. PyTorch is used for deep learning components, while NumPy is used extensively for numerical computation.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a portfolio of work demonstrating a strong grasp of AI principles and hands-on engineering capability. It reflects the ability to go from algorithm specification to working implementation, and to test, tune, and evaluate AI systems in realistic settings.
